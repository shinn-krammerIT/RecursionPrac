Class Activity Task 1 - Data Structure

Data structures are a pivotal feature to frontend Javascript. The three main data structures are Array-like, node and hash function structures. 

Array-like data structure:
Array-like data structures splits into 2 types. Stacks and Queues. 
A stack being known as a FILO (First In Last Out) structure and a Queue being known as the FIFO (First In First Out) structure. 
Queue
First In............................Last In
(Head) - (node) - (node) - (Tail) <- (New Node)
First Out
<- (Head) (New Head) - (node) - (node) - (Tail - New Node)

Stacks
First In.............................Last In
(Head) - (node) - (node) - (Tail) <- (New Node)
Last Out.............................First Out
(Head) - (node) - (node) - (Tail) (New Node) ->

Nodes 
As seen in the above diagram there are nodes present. Node data structures are items that can be accessed in a single direction of choosing or accessed in both directions by referecncing one another. 
This can be seen through the node types of Linked Lists, Trees and Graphs. 

Hash 
The hash function is the last main data structure which uses hash key data referencing. The hash function is primarily used in hash tables for searching and retrieving data. Hash tables are incredibly efficient and are used in most data search programs.
